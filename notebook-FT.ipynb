Tahapan ini biasanya dilakuakan sebelum anda melakukan tahapan EDA yang telah Anda pelajari sebelumnya. Tahapan ini perlu dilakukan jika data yang Anda miliki tidak 'bersih', sehingga perlu dilakukan pemrosesan terlebih dahulu (tahapan pre-processing) sebelum data tersebut masuk kedalam algoritma pembangunan model. \n","\n","Materi praktikum ini dibagi menjadi 2 bagian dengan menggunakan dua dataset yang berbeda. Adapun operasi akan Anda lakukan antara lain \n","* Melihat bentuk data (shape) dari data train dan test set\n","* Cek data NaN, bila ada maka hapus/drop data NaN tsb\n","* Cek outliers, bila ada maka hapus/drop outliers tsb\n","* Melakukan konversi jenis kolom yang relevan.\n","* Melakukan transformasi terhadap data yang bersifat kategori \n","\n","Operasi yang Anda lakukan pada tahapan pembersihan data sangat bergantung pada karakteristik permasalahan, karakter data, serta jenis data yang terdapat dalam dataset Anda. Sebagai referensi, berikut bagan dari berbagai macam tipe data yang mungkin Anda temui dalam sebuah dataset.
